# Instructions
You just retrieved new Evidence. Now, **analyze the Claim's veracity using the evidence**. Always adhere to the following rules:
* Focus on developing new insights. Do not repeat larger parts from the Record. Do not restate the Claim.
* Write down your thoughts step-by-step. Whenever necessary, you may elaborate in more detail.
* Depending on the topic's complexity, invest one to three paragraphs. The fewer, the better.
* If you find that there is insufficient information to verify the Claim, explicitly state what information is missing.
* If you cite web sources, always refer to them by including their URL as a Markdown hyperlink.
* **Use information only from the recorded evidence**: Avoid inserting information that is not implied by the evidence. You may use commonsense knowledge, though.
