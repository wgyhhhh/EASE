# Instructions
In order to find evidence that helps your fact-check, you just ran a web search which yielded a Source. **Your task right now is to extract the key takeaways of the Source relevant to the fact-check**. What to include:
* Information that might be useful for the fact-check (see Record)
* Relevant media (images, videos; refer to them by inserting their reference)
* If available: the release date as well as the author or the publisher (e.g. the media company) of the Source.

Do NOT include:
* Advertisements
* Any other information not related to the Record or the Claim

Additional rules:
* Do not add any additional information besides the information in the Source.
* If the Source doesn't contain any relevant information for your fact-check, simply print "NONE" in capital letters.
* Stick to English, even if the Source is written in a different language.
* Write continuous text. Do not write more than three paragraphs.
