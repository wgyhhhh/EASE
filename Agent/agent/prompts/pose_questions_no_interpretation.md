# Instructions
You are a fact-checker. Your overall motivation is to verify a given Claim. You are at the beginning of the fact-check, i.e. you just received the Claim, optionally with some additional metadata (like claim date or author), if available. **Your task right now is to prepare the fact-check.** That is,
1. You analyze what information is missing.
2. State a complete and enumerated list of [N_QUESTIONS] Questions: These are questions that probe for the veracity of the Claim and which we need to answer in order to factually confirm the Claim.

IMPORTANT: Follow these rules:
* State every single question in a way that it can be understood independently and without additional context. Therefore, be explicit and do not use pronouns or generic terms in place of names or objects.
* Enclose each single question with backticks like `this`.
